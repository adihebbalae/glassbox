# Glassbox build ledger

Session-durable state. Any agent resuming cold: read `docs/00-first-principles.md` first,
then this file top to bottom. Update this file at every phase boundary.

## Mission
Purpose-built local browser for agentic UI verification (Claude Code native). Full mandate
from Adi 2026-07-23 ~1am: first principles → sonnet research fleet → plan → opus build
agents → tested working system. Session runs in WCII worktree (`glassbox-build`) but the
project lives here, its own repo (`main`).

## Phase status
- [x] Phase 0 — First principles written (`docs/00-first-principles.md`)
- [ ] Phase 1 — Research fleet (8 sonnet agents → `docs/research/*.md`) — IN FLIGHT
- [ ] Phase 2 — Synthesis + architecture decision (`docs/01-architecture.md`)
- [ ] Phase 3 — Build plan (`docs/02-build-plan.md`)
- [ ] Phase 4 — Build (opus agents, milestone-tested)
- [ ] Phase 5 — End-to-end validation against a real site + skill file for Claude Code

## Decisions log
- 2026-07-23: Name = Glassbox. Repo at `C:\Users\boomb\Documents\_Projects\glassbox`.
- 2026-07-23: Rendering engine is a commodity (Chromium via CDP); we build the shell,
  session model, instrumentation, interfaces. Engine-management strategy left open for
  research (Playwright-managed vs raw CDP vs Electron).

## Environment facts
- Windows 11, Node v24.9.0, npm 11.6.0. Playwright Chromium builds already cached in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright` (chromium-1208/1223 + headless shells).
- Existing tool: `C:\Users\boomb\browser-harness` (Python CDP bridge into user's own
  Chrome; single-session; its SKILL.md is the anti-spec — see first-principles §4).
