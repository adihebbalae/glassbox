# Glassbox build ledger

Session-durable state. Any agent resuming cold: read `docs/00-first-principles.md` first,
then this file top to bottom. Update this file at every phase boundary.

## Mission
Purpose-built local browser for agentic UI verification (Claude Code native). Full mandate
from Adi 2026-07-23 ~1am: first principles → sonnet research fleet → plan → opus build
agents → tested working system. Session runs in WCII worktree (`glassbox-build`) but the
project lives here, its own repo (`main`).

## Phase status
- [x] Phase 0 — First principles written (`docs/00-first-principles.md`)
- [x] Phase 0.5 — Feasibility spikes (`spikes/SPIKES.md`): zero-dep CDP, debug plane,
      observation economics — all PASS
- [x] Phase 1 — Research fleet: 8/8 sonnet reports in `docs/research/` (1.01M tokens)
- [x] Phase 2 — Architecture decided (`docs/01-architecture.md`): Playwright lib +
      CDPSession escape hatch; daemon + named-context sessions; CLI+MCP duality
- [x] Phase 3 — Build plan (`docs/02-build-plan.md`): milestones M1–M8
- [x] Phase 4 (partial) — M1 (10/10) → M2 (12/12) → M3 (26/26) → M4 (23/23) →
      M6 (19/19) → M5 (23/23, MCP shim + CLI + skill). Suite `npm test` green, 113 checks.
- [ ] M7 — dev-loop (`glassbox dev`): spawn dev cmd, stdout-regex URL discovery, overlay
- [ ] M8 — E2E validation + hardening. Known items for M8: m4 `c2` flake under load
      (raise 60s daemonReq budget, catch AbortError → structured timeout); never run an
      in-process fixture server alongside spawnSync; MCP smoke via skill/mcp-config-example.json
- [ ] Phase 5 — validation vs WCII dev server + README + memory write

## Decisions log
- 2026-07-23: Name = Glassbox. Repo at `C:\Users\boomb\Documents\_Projects\glassbox`.
- 2026-07-23: Rendering engine is a commodity (Chromium via CDP); we build the shell,
  session model, instrumentation, interfaces. Engine-management strategy left open for
  research (Playwright-managed vs raw CDP vs Electron).

## Environment facts
- Windows 11, Node v24.9.0, npm 11.6.0. Playwright Chromium builds already cached in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ms-playwright` (chromium-1208/1223 + headless shells).
- Existing tool: `C:\Users\boomb\browser-harness` (Python CDP bridge into user's own
  Chrome; single-session; its SKILL.md is the anti-spec — see first-principles §4).
